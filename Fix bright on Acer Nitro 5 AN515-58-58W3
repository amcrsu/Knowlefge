On Acer laptops with hybrid graphics (Intel XE and Nvidia RTX3050) the brightness control don't work on linux distributions (very tested) after installed.

Open the grub file in `/etc/default/grub`.
`sudo nano /etc/default/grub`
 
Change the line:

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi_backlight=video"`

Or, depending on the distro:

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=native"`

After modification, give the command:
`sudo update-grub`

If this command doesn't work, install the grub-customizer and apply after open the application.

This commands was tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Mint (after updating the kernel to version 6 or higher), PopOS (with grub), ZorinOS, Fedora, OpenSuse, EndeavourOS and Manjaro, being KDE or Gnome.
